# vscode-markdown-handy README

## Reason

Recently, I could not bear the slowness of atom and the crash from time to time, so I started using vscode.

I did not find the extension about markdown that I like. I want to build it that I satisfied, However, I am not good at javascript and do not know much about the advanced skills or modules. Finally, I decided to customize combine the existing extension to customize a extension of my own.
